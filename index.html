        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <i><b>SSD</b></i> is written for 12 performers of any
            instrumentation. Each player is assigned one square on the screen
            and all read from the same screen that is projected in the space.
            Player 1 is the top-left most square, with Player 2 being the bar to
            the immediate right of that, and so on for each player like the
            direction of reading a book. The players can all be placed in one
            central place on stage, or throughout the concert space.
          </li>
          <li>
            The score follows these rules:            
              <li>
                The piece is for any instrument of any type. Players are to stay
                in their square.
              </li>
              <li>
                Players circulate between three distinct actions that appear in
                their square, they are:<br />
                - SAME<br />
                - SIMILAR<br />
                - DIFFERENT<br />
              </li>
              <li>
                The context of the current action is based on the performed
                action that preceded it. For example, if a piano plays a Middle
                C at forte, and an indication of
                <b>"SAME"</b> appears, then that player does the
                <b>SAME</b> thing. If a <b>"SIMILAR"</b> action is assigned,
                that could be something like a G above Middle C at <i>forte</i>,
                or Middle C at <i>mezzo-piano</i>. While a
                <b>"DIFFERENT"</b> action could be a chromatic run up and down
                the piano.
              </li>
              <li>
                Players circulate between SAME/SIMILAR/DIFFERENT. And it is
                encouraged that all performers meditate on this idea of context
                within their instrument.
              </li>
              <li>
                As the action assignments circulate, players can carry over
                actions or continue an action that is in progress until they
                wish to stop, temporarily ignoring the score and/or more
                seamlessly blending actions together. For example, if a
                violinist is sustaining on an open A string, they may keep that
                action in effect overlapping the next assigned action, even if
                it is <b>"DIFFERENT"</b>, and they can either go into something
                different, or choose to keep sustaining; as it is a continuous
                action.
              </li>
              <li>
                Additionally, players may opt for silence during an assigned
                action, but should only choose this if the context of
                <b>"DIFFERENT"</b> applies. For example, if a piano player plays
                Middle C at <i>forte</i>, they can stay silent if the next
                action indicated is <b>"DIFFERENT"</b>. If they choose this
                path, and the next action is <b>"SAME"</b>, then the silence
                remains.
              </li>
            
          </li>
        </ul>
